//    have a client expecting to make calls on target interface (old vendor)
//    and the target interface is not available to the client.
//    an adaptor class implements that interface and provides the client with the
//    functionality of the target interface by making calls on an adaptee class (the new vendor).
//    and so the calls from the client are passed through the adaptor class to the adaptee class. client is unaware of any changes.
